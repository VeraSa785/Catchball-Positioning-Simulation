## Description:
The Catchball Positioning Web App, meticulously crafted by Vera Sazonova, is a revolutionary project dedicated to the vibrant community of catchball enthusiasts and teams. Catchball, a captivating team sport derived from volleyball, places a unique emphasis on the art of catching and throwing the ball. Our web app serves as an invaluable resource designed to offer an interactive and insightful guide, empowering players to master the art of positioning, elevate their skills, and refine their strategic gameplay. 🚀

## Project Vision:
At the heart of this project lies a fusion of my dual passions: programming and the exhilarating world of catchball. Catchball is a team sport derived from volleyball in which the ball is caught and thrown rather than hit. 

In this web app, I am committed to crafting a comprehensive court positioning model that not only elucidates defensive techniques but also dives deep into the intricacies of offensive plays. As a team captain myself, I understand the paramount importance of effective communication and collaboration with our coach. This web app will become an indispensable tool for both players and coaches, facilitating the seamless exchange of insights, strategies, and tactical adjustments.
